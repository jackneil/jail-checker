- you are running on windows. ## CRITICAL: File Editing on Windows

### ⚠️ MANDATORY: Always Use Backslashes on Windows for File Paths

**When using Edit or MultiEdit tools on Windows, you MUST use backslashes (`\`) in file paths, NOT forward slashes (`/`).**

#### ❌ WRONG - Will cause errors:
```
Edit(file_path: "D:/repos/project/file.tsx", ...)
MultiEdit(file_path: "D:/repos/project/file.tsx", ...)
```

#### ✅ CORRECT - Always works:
```
Edit(file_path: "D:\repos\project\file.tsx", ...)
MultiEdit(file_path: "D:\repos\project\file.tsx", ...)
```
- Search the Dorchester County South Carolina Jail inmate database for any defendant listed on my list that are currently in custody.  Produce a report listing the defendants from my list that are currently in custody.  I want to be able to drop the new list into a folder and run this query every Monday morning. You should use api call to the jail website backend to get the response ... don't try to post through the website. but you should investigate the website source code to see how it sends queries to the backend

when running python files, always use the jail_checker conda env. and first find the full path to the python executable and always use the full path for your commands
